# React Hooks

Hooks let you use state and other React features in functional components.

## List of Hooks
1. [useState](./useState.md) – Manage local state
2. [useRef](./useRef.md) – Access DOM nodes and persist values

## Best Practices
- Prefer hooks over class lifecycle methods for new code
- Use multiple hooks for separation of concerns
- Name custom hooks with the `use` prefix

## Exercises
1. Refactor a class component to use hooks
2. Build a custom hook for form input handling
