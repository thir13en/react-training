# Virtual DOM

On every prop and state change, components do a diff between the potentially newly rendered DOM and the current one, which allows React to only re-render those elements that are different in the diff operation. This is why we need to pass `key` property to lists, so that React can keep track of the elements through the identifiers and does not need to diff them by deeply comparing their values, which would be highly inefficient.
